**FinalSpeed-X** is a extended support project for FinalSpeed Java Client originally written by d1sm which was discontinued. FinalSpeed-X is mainly based on the code of FinalSpeed 1.12.

> *Please note that the current version is only tested using Mac OS X El Capitan. Performance on other systems may be unpredictable.*

##How to Build
Download the code or clone to a local directory then  import it using Eclipse (Haven't tested other IDEs yet). **JDK 1.7** is recommended for best compatibility. Right click on the imported project, click on Configure Build Path, then add in the external jars included in the directory.
> Since I haven't pack some of the libraries into jars or remove unused references for the convenience of debugging, there may be lots of source files and redundant code.

Create a run configuration and make the main class `FSClient` under `net.fs.client`
